In the absence of more details or a data dictionary, I’m going to assume ‘ideo’ means ideology, without full understanding for what it represents. 
Also, under same conditions, I’m assuming negative class (target = 0) for opposing the ballot, and positive class (target = 1) for approving it. Analysis would be reversed if it’s the other way around. 

First scan showed strong correlation between ideology and opposing or approving the ballot; so is with political party affiliation. Not surprisingly, there’s a strong correlation between ideology and party affiliation. Looks like most Democrats have ideology =1 and most Republicans have ideology = -1, with some from both parties sharing ideology = 0. 

People holding ideology 1 tend to oppose the ballot, people holding ideology -1 tend to approve it. 
Democrats tend to oppose the ballot, while Republicans tend to approve it. 
At this point, I’m suspecting the ballot about restricting access to women’s health care is related to banning abortion. 

Employment has no significant effect on how people voted, neither does race, although people of black race tend to oppose the ballot more, less noticeable for the Latins, and whites. 

Gender doesn’t have a significant effect either, although more women than men tend to oppose the ballot, surprisingly. 

Education didn’t have an effect on how people voted. I would expect educated people to oppose the ballot more, but it is not the case. 

Recommendations:
---------------
To encourage people who would oppose the ballot to vote, we need first to target more Democrats, and people who have ideology 1, and avoid Republicans and people who have ideology -1
Second, if means are possible, I would also suggest educating people, women particularly, about the benefits of the ballot in case they can’t see it right away. 
It is important to be aggressive in those efforts because the model predicted only 30% to oppose the ballot in the testing set.
